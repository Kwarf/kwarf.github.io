In an [earlier post](/2015/02/building-a-steam-machine-part-1/) I built,
installed and benchmarked a steam machine. The only thing that was missing was
the case, and I promised an update when I got it, and it arrived in the mail
today.

There's not really much to show, it's an [EMKO EM-154B](http://www.emko.cz/en/catalog/it-cases/mini-itx/mini-itx-standard/em-154-alu-silver-h1572)
that I bought from [Mini-ITX.se](http://www.mini-itx.se/em154bminstaitxchassit-p-568.html).
It has a bit of an industrial look to it, but it doesn't bother me, and it was
the smallest Mini-ITX case I could find.

The only issue I had was that the connector on the SATA power cable that came
with the motherboard was angled in the wrong direction. So when mounting the SSD
in the lid of the case it didn't fit. This was easy to solve though, just remove
the cap on the rear of the connector, pull out the cables, flip the connector
over and push them back in. Just make sure to put them in the same place.
