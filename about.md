I live in Sweden, so if my English is weird from time to time it's because it's
not my native language.

I currently (2016-) work as a C# developer. Before that I was working in
embedded development (2010-2016), using mostly C++ and C, targeting ARM and AVR.
So I have a somewhat mixed programming background.

Most of my spare time is spent in front of my computer, programming, gaming, or
_attempting_ to make music. I enter [Ludum Dare](http://ludumdare.com) now and
then but other than that I don't submit much of what I do publically.

My other hobby is flying pretty much all kinds of remote controlled things,
like planes, helicopters, autogiros and multirotors. I don't really like
building models, so I buy most of my stuff RTF, leaving more time to fly.

I also have a motorcycle, specifically a Suzuki SV650SA that I ride during the
summer when the weather allows.

## About my computers

I run [Arch Linux](http://archlinux.org) on my main laptop, as well as a
24/7/365 server that I share with a friend. I've never had any major issues or
breakages on any of my installations.

I'm currently running [KDE Plasma](https://www.kde.org/plasma-desktop). I
recently switched from [i3](https://i3wm.org/), because I felt like I was
spending too much time configuring and setting stuff up.

### Primary laptop

A ThinkPad T460p running [Arch Linux](http://archlinux.org) and
[KDE Plasma](https://www.kde.org/plasma-desktop). This is the computer I
primarily use for development and regular daily web-browsing.

I usually have it docked, using it as a desktop.

* Intel Core i7 6700HQ 2.6GHz (3.5GHz turbo)
* NVIDIA GeForce 940MX 2GB
* Samsung 32GB 2133MHz
* 512GB Samsung PM871a
* 14" 1440p IPS (matte)
* Intel Wireless-AC 8260

### Secondary laptop

A Clevo W650SZ on which I run Windows 10. I use this for any Windows-specific
development, as well as for CAD drawings (using [Fusion 360](http://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview)).

The build quality isn't very high, but that is to be expected from such a cheap
(around $900) computer, and it doesn't bother me much, performance is more
important for me.

* Intel Core i7 4710MQ 2.5GHz (3.5GHz turbo)
* Kingston HyperX 8GB 1600MHz
* 120GB Kingston SSDNow mS200 (mSATA)
* 15.6" 1080p IPS (matte)
* Intel Wireless-AC 7260

### Desktop

This is my "gaming rig", running Windows 10. Some of the parts have been moved
along in multiple upgrades, and are starting to feel pretty old (looking at the
CPU and RAM). However it more than satisfies my needs.

* ASRock Fatal1ty Z77 Professional-M
* Intel Core i7 2600k @ 4.5GHz
* Crucial BallistiX 8GB 1600MHz CL8
* 2 x GTX Titan SLI
* 512GB Samsung 840 Pro
* BitFenix Phenom M
* Dell UltraSharp U2515H monitor
* Filco Majestouch TLK with blank caps

### NAS / Home server

This is where I store media and stuff that should be accessible from all my
computers. It's pretty much built from leftovers, except the disks.

* Asus P7P55D-E
* Intel Core i7 870 (2.93GHz)
* 16GB RAM
* 64GB SanDisk SSD
* 2 x 4TB WD Red in software RAID1

### Bedroom HTPC

When I bought a new monitor to my desktop computer I decided to use one of the
old ones for a small HTPC in my bedroom. I needed something passive so I went
for the Raspberry Pi 2. You can read about the build [here](/2015/02/arch-and-kodi-on-the-raspberry-pi-2/).

* Raspberry Pi 2
* 8GB Class 10 MicroSD
* D-Link DWA-127 802.11n USB NIC
