I live in Sweden, so if my English is weird from time to time it's because it's
not my native language. And no, we don't have polar bears here.

I work as an embedded software developer using mostly C++ and C, targeting ARM
and AVR.

Most of my spare time is spent in front of my computer, programming, gaming, or
_attempting_ to make music. I enter [Ludum Dare](http://ludumdare.com) now and
then but other than that I don't submit much of what I do publically.

My other hobby is flying pretty much all kinds of remote controlled things,
like planes, helicopters, autogiros and multirotors. I don't really like
building models, so I buy most of my stuff RTF, leaving more time to fly.

I also have a motorcycle, specifically a Suzuki SV650SA that I ride during the
summer when the weather allows.

## About my computers

I run [Arch Linux](http://archlinux.org) on all my computers, including a
24/7/365 server that I share with a friend as well as my computer at work. I've
never had any major issues or breakages on any of my installations.

I prefer the [awesome](http://awesome.naquadah.org/) window manager as I often
open things side by side, and having as little unused/wasted space as possible
is nice when I'm using my laptop. It also allowed me to switch from 2 x 24"
monitors to a single 27" without going mental. I used to run [i3](https://i3wm.org/)
but I always found myself manually arranging the windows in the same way each
time I started stuff and thought that it'd be nice to have the WM do that
automatically so I switched to awesome.

### Desktop

This is the only computer where I have a Windows 7 dual-boot setup (for
gaming). Some of the parts have been moved along in multiple upgrades, and are
starting to feel pretty old (looking at the CPU and RAM). However it more than
satisfies my needs.

* ASRock Fatal1ty Z77 Professional-M
* Intel Core i7 2600k @ 4.5GHz
* Crucial BallistiX 8GB 1600MHz CL8
* 2 x GTX Titan SLI
* 512GB Samsung 840 Pro
* BitFenix Phenom M
* Asus ROG Swift PG278Q 144Hz G-SYNC monitor
* Filco Majestouch TLK with blank caps

### Laptop

I spent quite a bit of time looking for a suitable laptop with good performance
for a reasonable price. I wanted a quad-core since I usually compile things
quite often, and I also didn't want a dedicated GPU since Optimus on Linux
scares me and I won't even be gaming on it.

The desicion landed on a Clevo W650SZ which is a Chinese OEM laptop that is sold
on multiple places online. I bought mine from [GGS-Data](http://www.ggsdata.se/)
here in Sweden for 7825 SEK (around $1k depending on the exchange rate).

The build quality isn't very high, but that is to be expected from such a cheap
computer, and it doesn't bother me much, performance is more important for me.

* Intel Core i7 4710MQ 2.5GHz (3.5GHz turbo)
* Kingston HyperX 8GB 1600MHz
* 120GB Kingston SSDNow mS200 (mSATA)
* 15.6" 1080p IPS (matte)
* Intel Wireless-AC 7260

### NAS / Home server

This is where I store media and stuff that should be accessible from all my
computers. It's pretty much built from leftovers, except the disks.

* Asus P7P55D-E
* Intel Core i5 660 (3.33GHz)
* 4GB RAM
* 64GB SanDisk SSD
* 2 x 4TB WD Red in software RAID1

### Bedroom HTPC

When I bought a new monitor to my desktop computer I decided to use one of the
old ones for a small HTPC in my bedroom. I needed something passive so I went
for the Raspberry Pi 2. You can read about the build [here](/2015/02/arch-and-kodi-on-the-raspberry-pi-2/).

* Raspberry Pi 2
* 8GB Class 10 MicroSD
* D-Link DWA-127 802.11n USB NIC
