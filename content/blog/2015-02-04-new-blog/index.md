I used to host my own [WordPress](https://wordpress.com) blog, but since I hardly ever post anything it
felt a bit overkill. Keeping it updated was also quite a pain, I hate running
out-of-date software but I also hate updating things manually.

So I've decided to move to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). It uses
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to generate static pages, and you write posts
using [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) syntax.
Everything is kept in a public git repo.

I still want people to be able to comment on posts even though everything is
static html pages, so I added [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) for that. It
dynamically loads comments into the DOM using JavaScript. It will also allow me
to move to a different blog platform in the future and still keep all comments
(provided that I use Disqus on the new site as well of course).

I'm kind of hoping that this update will inspire me to become more active, and
post more. Even if I don't have many readers it can still function as my
personal project log, or something like that.
